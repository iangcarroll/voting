## TODO
* Unit tests (urgent).
* Refactor `CandidacyController@create`.
* Refactor the `canNominate()` and `canVote()` helper functions in `app/helpers.php`.
* Allow the use of custom URLs to nominate a candidate in addition to our app-scoped UIDs.
* Send an email when a user becomes eligible to run.
* Show how many more nominations a user needs to run.
* Better setup documentation (Heroku Button?)
